# workout
API for logging exercise information


## Roadmap
1. CRUD API (done)

   Simple api to log, retrieve, update and delete exercise info - sport, duration, description, distance etc
   
2. Hook up a DB

   Persistant storage, eg Postgres. Currently uses a basic SQLite driver/db
   
3. Frontend

   Basic frontend to access the api (possibly a seperate service?)
   
4. Retrieve and display stats

   eg distance run, time spent exercising etc
