# exercise-tracker
API for logging exercise information


## Roadmap
1. CRUD API

   Simple api to log, retrieve, update and delete exercise info - sport, duration, description, distance etc
   
2. Hook up a DB

   Persistant storage, eg Postgresql
   
3. Frontend

   Basic frontend to access the api (possibly a seperate service?)
   
4. Retrieve and display stats
   eg distance run, time spent exercising etc
